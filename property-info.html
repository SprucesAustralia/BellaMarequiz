    <!-- Property & Layout Section -->
    <section id="property-layout">
      <h2>Property & Layout</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The resort/property has around 25–26 apartments in total.</li>
        <li>There are 8 stairwells, each containing around 7 apartments (a mix of 2-bedroom apartments and 2-bedroom villas at the top).</li>
        <li>No elevators; all floors are accessed by stairs.</li>
        <li>There is one gym on-site that needs daily cleaning (vacuuming + equipment wipe-down).</li>
        <li>There is 1 three-bedroom apartment in the complex; the rest are primarily 2-bedroom apartments (or villas).</li>
        <li>Each apartment has its own laundry facilities (washer and dryer).</li>
        <li>Most apartments have a shower over the bath in the second bathroom; only about 2 apartments have shower curtains (the rest have glass panels).</li>
        <li>No dedicated spa baths; there are no large spa tubs requiring special cleaning.</li>
        <li>The complex has no lifts, so cleaners typically bring supplies to the bottom of each stairwell and then carry items up.</li>
        <li>Thursday is generally the quietest day.</li>
        <li>Vacuuming of stairwells is required once a week; this can be spread out, as long as each stairwell is done weekly.</li>
        <li>The gym requires daily vacuuming and wiping down of equipment.</li>
        <li>Management is open to flexible scheduling. If it gets busier, more cleaners can be called in via a WhatsApp broadcast system.</li>
        <li>Check-ins are generally from 2 PM; check-outs at 10 AM. Some guests leave earlier, and about two requests per week come in for late check-outs.</li>
      </ul>
